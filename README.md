## Description 
This application is a social network API that uses a NoSQL database. As a backend, it allows for the creation, editing, and deletion of a new user. That user can then add others as friends, share their thoughts, and react to other users' thoughts. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
